<h1>Rig-Op</h1>   


Is an offshore operational reporting system designed to streamline and centralize key functions within an offshore environment. It provides a comprehensive platform for managing maintenance, inventory, support tickets, and emergency communications.

<h1>Features</h1>
Rig-Op is built with a suite of integrated features to enhance efficiency and safety:<br></br>

**Maintenance Management**: Log maintenance tasks based on specific areas and machinery that require attention. This is amplified by a risk-assessment formula that intelligently prioritizes and targets key areas in need of maintenance. This ensures critical issues are addressed proactively.

**Inventory & Ordering**: Users can view the current inventory and order more material as needed to complete jobs. The system ensures that the right parts are available at the right time, minimizing downtime.

**Ticket Submission**: A dedicated system for submitting support tickets for a wide range of issues. This allows for clear tracking and efficient resolution of non-emergency problems.

**Support System**: Access to a robust support system for both emergency and non-emergency situations. This includes AI-powered assistance that is tailored to company policy and machine documentation, providing immediate guidance and support.
